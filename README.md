# Defense-Mechanism-using-image-processing

The current defence system which is used in high security zones and areas doesn’t provide much security and protection. This in an autonomous robotic system which will improve protection to the specified
area and doesn’t require presence of humans on field.

This system will be majorly used in high security areas where common man entrance is prohibited. It can also be used in banks, high security prisons by law and enforcement. The objective of the proposed system is to identify, classify and then take necessary action (either under the supervision of human authority or autonomously). In order to prove the concept a differential drive base robotic system with camera is created. The threats are represented using either a non-fictional object like balloon or moving targets. The main obstacle here is to accurately aim at the target with minimum percentage of
error. One more highlights of our proposed system is durability.
